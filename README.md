ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at Cypress College, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer

##I am interested in AI and machine learning and their role in shaping the future of technology. Currently, I am interning at The Root Remedy, where I am developing a generative AI-powered iOS app that provides nutrition advice and educates users on gut health. I have strong skills in problem-solving, coding, data analysis, and research, and Iâ€™m eager to continue refining these abilities. Iâ€™m actively seeking new internship opportunities, particularly in AI and machine learning. Let me know!
